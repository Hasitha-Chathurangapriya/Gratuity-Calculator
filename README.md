# Gratuity-Calculator

<p>I created a Gratuity-Calculator for a postal union.Here, calculating the retirement gratuity in this arrangement usually takes many hours because time has to be allocated to the relevant calculations. I created a gratuity calculator as a solution to this. Therefore, the gratuity calculation time was limited to two minutes. They were able to achieve very high efficiency.</p>
